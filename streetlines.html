	State Capitol, the most iconic silhouette in our city's skyline, the Wisconsin State Capitol is the tallest building in Madison â€” and the dome is one of the largest in the world. The 100+-year-old Capitol building is the focal point of the city, right on the isthmus between lakes Mendota and Monona (you can even see both lakes from the outdoor observation deck). Surrounding this architectural wonder is all the incredible food, art, shopping and things to do in downtown Madison.
